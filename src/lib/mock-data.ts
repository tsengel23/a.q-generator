    summary:
      "Genghis Khan, born Temüjin around 1162, was the founder of the Mongol Empire. After his father's death, Temüjin's family was left in poverty, and he later killed his half-brother to secure his position. He built alliances with leaders like Jamukha and Toghrul, and despite being defeated in battle and briefly under the Jin dynasty, he rose to power by defeating rivals. By 1206, after overcoming the Naiman tribe and executing Jamukha, Temüjin became the undisputed ruler of the Mongol steppe.",

      "Genghis Khan (born Temüjin; c. 1162 – August 1227), also known as Chinggis Khan, was the founder and first khan of the Mongol Empire. After spending most of his life uniting the Mongol tribes, he launched a series of military campaigns, conquering large parts of China and Central Asia. Born between 1155 and 1167 and given the name Temüjin, he was the eldest child of Yesugei, a Mongol chieftain of the Borjigin clan, and his wife Hö'elün. When Temüjin was eight, his father died and his family was abandoned by its tribe. Reduced to near-poverty, Temüjin killed his older half-brother to secure his familial position. His charismatic personality helped to attract his first followers and to form alliances with two prominent steppe leaders named Jamukha and Toghrul; they worked together to retrieve Temüjin's newlywed wife Börte, who had been kidnapped by raiders. As his reputation grew, his relationship with Jamukha deteriorated into open warfare.",
